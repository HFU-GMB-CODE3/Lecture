Adding a spotlight in WebGL.

## Plan

We start with the debug code, you get here: [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/GUy5N4Qb)

- Fix the mouse rotation
- Fix the camera and view matrix if needed

We then add normals and a point light source which we turn into a spot light (using step function in shader)

## Slides

- Debugging: [slides](files/CODE3-Debugging.pdf)
- Spotlight: [slides](files/CODE3-Spotlight.pdf)

## Tasks
  
- [ ] Make it a soft spot with smoothstep and a double slider for the inner and outer radius
 
## Insights

- TBD
