## Goals

Flat shaded cube with rotation animation and perspective camera

## Assignment

**Use the repository from last time and follow the instructions in the slides:**

![eyes](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f440.png?v8) means that the code is already in the repository and you just need to look at it.

![clipboard](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4cb.png?v8) means you can copy-paste the code and it should work.

![memo](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png?v8) means that you need to create a new file

![o](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2b55.png?v8) indicates that you need to do more than just copy-paste the code.

**In any case you need to understand what you are doing.**

## Material
  
- Slides:
  - [A 3D cube in WebGL](files/CODE3-04-Cube.pdf)
  - [Transformations in WebGL](files/CODE3-05-Transformations.pdf)

## List of things to implement extending the cube 3D demo

In the following, some tasks are listed that need to be implemented in order to better understand the implemented code.

### Simple

(small and easy code changes)

- [ ] Change the **size** of the cube
- [ ] Change the **color** of the cube
- [ ] Change the position of the cube to the top left of the canvas by modifying the **viewport**
- [ ] Change the rotation speed of the cube

### Complex

(needs new functions)

- [ ] Change the color of the cube so that each edge has the same color on both adjacent faces, but there is a color gradient on each face.
- [ ] Let the cube pulsate (change its size) in a sinusoidal way.
- [ ] Draw a thousand cubes instead of one.
- [ ] Change the camera to an **orthographic** camera (check [gl-matrix](https://glmatrix.net/docs/module-mat4.html) for a helper function)

## Insights

- TBD
